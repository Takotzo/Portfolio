                    I challenged myself to not do programming that semester, as I had not yet discovered technical art, and was focusing on artistic parts of game creation. Throughout the
                    semester I designed, drew concept, modelled, rigged and animated multiple character for the game. Unfortunately I didn't get as much time animating as I hoped for,
                    but I think the animation turned out great.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I cooperated with my teammates asking for feedback on every step from concept to animation. I would also help out implementing the characters in
                    Unity, the game engine we were using, and make sure they were correct having the right materials and animation clips linked to them. Learnt a lot about
                    the creation process and had fun discovering new tools for <strong>Maya</strong> as the spring IK solver.

                    Nord University tasked us with creating a game for each semester, on our second we decided we wanted to try creating a VR game focusing on motion controls.
                The selling point was that the player would be playing a robot with springs for arms and when the payer punched forward in real life the digital hand would
                go flying and attach to a surface, then the player could pull their hand back to leap in that direction
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game is not fully finished, we wanted more time on creating story and a progression in gameplay but there were simply not enough time. The game is however 
                    playable and the player can explore all the areas created for the game. There is an end goal at the top of the city, but we are missing an end screen. Put on 
                    your VR headset and join the world of Spring~Boy!!
