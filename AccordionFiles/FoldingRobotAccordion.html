                        For a recent school assignment, I worked extensively in <strong>Maya</strong> to design and develop a unique character featuring six or more limbs. This project encompassed the full 3D production pipeline, highlighting my versatility and proficiency in multiple areas of 3D art.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I began by creating concept art to define the character's appearance and functionality. From there, I <strong>modeled</strong> the character with attention to proper topology for efficient rigging and animation. <strong>Rigging</strong> the skeleton came next, where I implemented a robust system to manage the complexities of animating additional limbs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also performed <strong>UV mapping</strong> to prepare the model for texturing and set up a custom <strong>controller</strong> to streamline the animation process. Finally, I brought the character to life by animating it and assembling all components into a cohesive, polished presentation. This project demonstrates my ability to combine technical expertise and artistic vision to bring creative concepts to fruition.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One aspect I’m particularly proud of is the controller I created, which allows the character to curl into a ball and move its eye independently. This controller significantly simplified the animation process and added versatility to the character’s movements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From the start, I set out to challenge myself by designing a character that could transform by curling into a ball. This required careful planning and problem-solving, particularly for the shell construction. My solution involved separate plates that functioned as armor when the character was walking and formed a cohesive wheel when curled up. This design not only enhanced the character’s functionality but also pushed me to think creatively about animation and rigging mechanics.

                        Throughout the <strong>semester</strong>, we had classes where our teacher introduced new techniques in <strong>Maya</strong>, walking us step-by-step through the process of creating an animated model. These lessons provided invaluable guidance as we worked on our characters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each week, I received constructive feedback from the teacher, which helped me refine and improve my character at every stage. This feedback was instrumental in identifying areas for enhancement and uncovering errors I hadn’t noticed before.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My teacher’s encouragement and positive remarks about my work—especially his comment that he was very happy with my character—were both motivating and affirming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the end, the dedication I put into this project, combined with the insights gained through feedback, resulted in an <strong>A grade</strong>. The experience not only deepened my understanding of the character creation process but also strengthened my skills in problem-solving and attention to detail.
