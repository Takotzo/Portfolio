                        I worked with a UI creation tool called <strong>Rive</strong> to design and implement an interactive user interface.
                        Rive utilizes inputs to switch between animations, which can also send signals to Unity for further interaction.
                        After creating the UI and configuring all the events within Rive, I integrated it into Unity by developing a script
                        to manage these events and execute the appropriate methods, such as handling <code>resume</code> and <code>exit</code>
                        button actions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some UI elements needed to be dynamically updated at runtime, so I designed accessible methods to allow team members
                        to easily modify these elements during development. Additionally, certain elements, such as sliders, required sending
                        their values to inform other components about their current state.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was my first experience working with Rive, and it provided an excellent opportunity to deepen my understanding of
                        the tool and its integration with Unity. I utilized various resources provided by Rive to learn how its system communicates
                        with Unity, enabling me to effectively extract inputs and events and implement them in a cohesive workflow.

                        The UI was developed for a game called <strong>Flashback</strong>, a university project that ran from October to December. In the game, players experience a narrative where they recall events from the past and relive them through engaging minigames.
                        My role focused on designing and implementing an interactive and dynamic user interface, ensuring it enhanced the game's storytelling and gameplay.

                    <p>
                        The project did not necessarily require Rive implementations and could have been completed using Unity alone. However, it provided a valuable opportunity to explore and experiment with a new tool, broadening my technical skillset.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Working with a team of fellow students, I contributed to the technical development while collaborating closely with designers and programmers to ensure the UI aligned with the game's overall vision. One key challenge was integrating Rive's unique animation system with Unity, which required researching and applying innovative solutions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This project taught me the value of experimenting with new tools and technologies, as well as the importance of creating accessible systems that empower team members. Looking back, I would like to explore ways to further optimize the Rive-Unity integration for better performance and extend the UI's interactivity for future projects.
