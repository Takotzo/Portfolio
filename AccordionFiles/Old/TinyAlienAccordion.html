                    For this project, we needed the ability to change the color of each object at runtime. To achieve this, I created a script that automatically changes the material of an object to the corresponding color when needed.
                    To streamline the process and make it more maintainable,
                    I designed a separate object that holds all the materials and colors. The script retrieves the appropriate material from this object based on the selected color and shade, which I defined within the script.
                    This setup makes it simple for other team members working on level design to attach the script to their objects and easily assign the correct color.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This approach also improves workflow efficiency, as level designers no longer need to manually assign colors to each object. By simply attaching the script and selecting a color from the predefined list,
                    they can quickly customize objects without worrying about the technical details of material handling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, when the scene loads, the script automatically assigns a default grey color to each object, ensuring that level editors don't need to worry about manually setting the material for each object.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This system was designed with performance in mind. By centralizing all materials and colors in one object, we minimize resource usage and avoid redundant assignments, making the color change process efficient even in complex scenes.

                    This script was developed for the game <strong>Tiny Alien</strong>, where an alien gets stuck on a planet and needs to collect crayons to fuel their ship and color the world around them. The script was critical to the game's
                    functionality and went through a few iterations as the game's design evolved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Initially, I created a separate script to manage the spawning of crayons in different scenes and their interactions when collected. Our original concept involved each scene starting in grey, with the player collecting colors to gradually colorize the world.
                    However, this idea was later adjusted, and we decided that one color would be used to color the entire game. Thankfully I made the script easily changeable, so I was able to easily adapt to this new design change and implement it smoothly.
                </p>

                    After completing the project and reflecting on my work, I’ve been considering the possibility that using Unity's <strong>Shader Graph</strong> could have been a more efficient solution than the one I implemented. Using shaders might have allowed
                    for a more flexible and visually appealing way to handle color changes across the game. This is something I plan to explore further in future projects.
